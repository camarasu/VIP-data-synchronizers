     * To test the synchronization in your machine you have to:
     * 1)Active the sshd server (sudo service sshd start)
     * 2)Create a database for test:
     *       **local database :you can run the class DataBaseTest and DataBaseOperations to create a local database
     *       **remote database(remote MYSQL server) for test you have to create an ssh tunnel for the mysql server:
     *         ssh -L [LOCAL PORT]:localhost:[REMOTE PORT] [USERNAME]@[SSH_SERVER] -f -N
     *         (option -f -N  to force ssh to go to background without running a particular command on the remote server)
     * 3)SSH TUNNEL FOR GRIDA(grida port and grida host are configured in the ssha config file)
     *        ssh -L [LOCALPORT]:localhost:[GRIDA PORT] [USER NAME]@[GRIDA SERVER] -f -N
     *        use SSHFS to mount a  temporary local directory (specified in the ssha config file) with a directory in grida server 
     *        these two directories have to take the some path and name
     *        sshfs [USERNAME]@[SSH REMOTE SERVER]:[REMOTE DIR] [LOCAL DIR] -o nonempty
